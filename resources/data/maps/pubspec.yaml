  # The "flutter_lints" package below contains a set of recommended lints to

  # The following line ensures that the Material Icons font is
  # included with your application, so that you can use the icons in
  # the material Icons class.

  # To add assets to your application, add an assets section, like this:
  assets:
    - assets/
    - assets/avatars/
    - assets/fill/
    - assets/symbols/2.0x/
    - assets/symbols/3.0x/
    - assets/images/onboarding/
    - assets/fonts/
    - assets/fonts/cera_pro/
  #   - images/a_dot_ham.jpeg

  # An image asset can refer to one or more resolution-specific "variants", see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#resolution-aware.

  # For details regarding adding assets from package dependencies, see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#from-packages

  # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
  # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:
  fonts:
    - family: CeraPro
      fonts:
        - asset: assets/fonts/cera_pro/Cera-Pro-Black-Italic.otf
          weight: 900
          style: italic
        - asset: assets/fonts/cera_pro/Cera-Pro-Black.otf
          weight: 900
        - asset: assets/fonts/cera_pro/Cera-Pro-Bold.otf
          weight: 700
        # - asset: assets/fonts/cera_pro/Cera-Pro-Regular.otf
        - asset: assets/fonts/cera_pro/Cera-Pro-Medium.otf
        - asset: assets/fonts/cera_pro/Cera-Pro-Light.otf
          weight: 300
        - asset: assets/fonts/cera_pro/Cera-Pro-Regular-Italic.otf
          style: italic
  #   - family: Trajan Pro
  #     fonts:
  #       - asset: fonts/TrajanPro.ttf
  #       - asset: fonts/TrajanPro_Bold.ttf
  #         weight: 700
