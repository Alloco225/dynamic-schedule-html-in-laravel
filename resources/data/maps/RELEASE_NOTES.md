2017-09-19

* Added [`schemas`](https://github.com/openservicebrokerapi/servicebroker/blob/v2.13/spec.md#schema-object)
  field to services in the catalog that brokers can use to declare the
  configuration parameters their service accepts for creating a service

  about using characters outside of the "Unreserved Characters" set in IDs.
* Added information about
  [`volume_mounts`](https://github.com/openservicebrokerapi/servicebroker/blob/v2.13/spec.md#volume-mounts-object)
  objects.
* `instance_id` and `binding_id` MUST be globally unique non-empty strings.
* Allow [non-BasicAuth authentication mechanisms](https://github.com/openservicebrokerapi/servicebroker/blob/v2.13/spec.md#authentication).
* Added a [Getting Started](https://github.com/openservicebrokerapi/servicebroker/blob/v2.13/gettingStarted.md)

## [v2.12](https://github.com/openservicebrokerapi/servicebroker/blob/v2.12/spec.md)

2017-06-13

* Added `context` field to request body for provisioning a service instance (`PUT /v2/service_instances/:instance_id`) and updating a service instance (`PATCH /v2/service_instances/:instance_id`). Also added the [profile.md](https://github.com/openservicebrokerapi/servicebroker/blob/master/profile.md) file describing RECOMMENDED usage patterns for environment-specific extensions and variations. `context` will replace the `organization_guid` and `space_guid` request fields in future versions of the specification. In the interim, both SHOULD be used to ensure interoperability with old and new implementations.
* The specification now uses RFC2119 keywords to make it clearer when things are REQUIRED rather than OPTIONAL or RECOMMENDED.
* Request and response parameters of type string, if present, MUST be a non-empty string.
* Cleaned up text around status codes in responses, clarifying when they MUST be returned.
* Added clarity around the `app_guid` request field.
* Clarified the semantics of `plan_id` and `parameters` fields in the updating a service instance request body.
* Clarified the default value of the `plan_updateable` field.
* Clarified when `route_service_url` is REQUIRED and when brokers can return extra data in bindings.

## [v2.11](https://github.com/openservicebrokerapi/servicebroker/blob/v2.11/spec.md)

2016-11-15

* Added field `bindable` to plan objects in /v2/catalog response. This allows services to have both bindable and non-bindable plans.

## [v2.10](http://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/1-9/services/api.html)

2016-08-01

* Service bind responses now include an optional field called `volume_mounts`. Backward incompatible changes to `volume_mounts` field in service bind response from experimental 2.9 format to final format.

## [v2.9](http://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/1-8/services/api.html)

2016-06-14

* `last_operation` endpoint now supports `service_id` and `plan_id` as request parameters.

* A new field `operation` may now be returned by brokers in asynchronous responses for Provision, Update, Deprovision. This field enables brokers to provide an internal identifier for the operation that clients should provide back to the service broker when polling the `last_operation` endpoint.

## [v2.8](http://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/1-7/services/api.html)

2015-11-8

* In support for Route Services, service broker may now return a `route_service_url` in the response for a create binding request.

* A broker must specify `requires: ["route_forwarding"]` in its catalog endpoint if it supports Route Services.

* Clients may now send a new field `bind_resource` with the bind request, under which the parameters required for the binding are found. This would include, for example, `app_guid` for an app binding and `route` for a route binding. For backwards compatibility, `app_guid` will remain a top-level key in addition to being included in the `bind_resource`.

## [v2.7](http://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/1-6/services/api.html)

2015-10-08

* Added support for Asynchronous Operations. Brokers may now return a 202 Accepted in response to provision, update, or deprovision requests to indicate the requested operation is in progress.

* The parameter `accepts_incomplete=true` must be passed by the broker client with requests for provision, update, or deprovision to indicate support for an asynchronous response. The broker can then choose to execute the request synchronously or asynchronously.

* Added support for querying `last_operation` status at a new endpoint: `GET /v2/service_instances/:guid/last_operation`

## v2.6

2015-07-23

* `app_guid` field is no longer guaranteed to be included with create service binding requests

* New field `service_id` is required with update service instance requests

## v2.5

2015-06-23

* Added support for Arbitrary Parameters: service-specific configuration parameters that can be included with provision, update and bind requests

## v2.4

2014-10-31

* Added support for broker clients to change the service plan for a specified service instance using new Update Service Instance endpoint

## v2.3

2014-04-23

* Added `dashboard_client` field to /v2/catalog to enable broker client to provision OAuth client for a service dashboard

## v2.2

2014-03-31

* Added field `free` for service plan in catalog endpoint

## v2.1

2013-12-27
